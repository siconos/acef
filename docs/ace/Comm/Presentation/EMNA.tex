 It consists in replacing the Constitutive Equation of the non-smooth branch with the complementary
 formulation.

 \begin{block}{Unknowns}
 Before go ahead, the unknowns vector X is decomposed in:
\begin{itemize}
\item x which contains only the dynamic unknowns(currents in inductor and tensions from capacitor branches)
\item z which contains only the non dynamic unknowns(Voltage nodes,... ).
\end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  
 \begin{block}{A specific choice of unknowns yields the following system:}
 
 \begin{eqnarray}
x'=A_{2x}x +A_{2z}z +R \lambda +A_{2s}&\label{eq2}\\
0=B_{2x}x+B_{2z}z + B_{2\lambda}\lambda + B_{2s}&\label{eq3}\\
Y=D_{2x}x+D_{2z}z+D_{2\lambda}\lambda + D_{2s} &\label{eq4}\\
0 \leq Y \, \perp \, \lambda \geq 0&\label{eqperp}
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{itemize}
\item x which contains only the dynamic unknowns(currents in inductor and tensions from capacitor branches)
\item z which contains only the non dynamic unknowns(Voltage nodes,... ).
\end{itemize}

  \end{block}
