\begin{block}{Conclusion}
Siconos software provides: 
\begin{itemize}
\item a stand-alone open platform, operational and able to solve various non smooth problems. \\
Specifities: plug-in system, multiple interfaces, "macro language" (from $simulation\rightarrow run()$ to $computeRHS()$ )
\pause
\item or a plugged external library that provides a computational tools
\pause
\item not dedicated to a specific domain, possibly user add-on (toolboxes). 
\pause
\item more and more users (at least interested in ...): American Airlines, University of New Delhi, of Hong-Kong, JRL in Japan (haptic-robotic applications) ...
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\pause
\begin{block}{To do ...}  
\begin{itemize}
\item Documentation
\item Complete Event Driven (for first order systems, with friction ...)
\item Test on large systems + Optimisation
\item Use feedback from users to improve reliability
\item User-friendly post-treatment (VRML ...) 
\item \ldots  
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
