Let
\begin{itemize}
\item $N_{b}$ the number of branches.
\item $N_{n}$ the number of nodes.
\item N = max\{$N_{b},N_{n}$\}
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{The costs of the automatic circuit equation formulation:}

\begin{itemize}
\item To parse the Netlist : It consists in reading and storing the Netlist. O(N).
\item A topological analysis to build the unknowns vector:
The Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm complexity is O(Nlog(N))
\item Stamping method:
Each component writes its contribution in the table equation. O(N).
\item Matrix product:
Multiplied two dense matrices costs O($N^{3}$).
\end{itemize}
