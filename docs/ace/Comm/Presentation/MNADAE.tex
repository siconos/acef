\frametitle{MNA and DAE}
 \begin{block}{MNA leads to a DAE of the form:}
\[C(X)X'+J(X)-S(t)=0\]
With
\begin{itemize}
\item C(X) describing the dynamic elements.
\item J(X) describing the static ones.
\item S(t) describing the independent sources.
\end{itemize}
Index of the DAE : 0,1,2.
  \end{block}
In SPICE,the discretization of this equation is linearized and solved using the Newton-Raphson
  iterations.\\
  But, the non-smooth components such as diodes or transistors, result in troubles in this iterative
  method. A novel approach is to model this components with piecewise linear function and to
  formulate the problem as a Complementary Problem.
